# manifest-search-web

'''GO LOOK AT http://quickdocs.com''' it is more up to date and a 
better looking UI.  This project was released at the same time, 
but since quickdocs had a better name and a better UI, I decided 
not to push my site.

I have left this up as it was a neat project, but I dont plan on
supporting or doing more with it.

A Common Lisp library to make web accessible the results of 
searching common lisp documentation (ala manifest-search).

Uses Hunchentoot web server to serve json and HTML
